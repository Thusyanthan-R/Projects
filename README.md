# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis projects repository! Here, I share a variety of projects that demonstrate my passion for uncovering insights through data. Each project highlights my skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualisation, and reporting.

I work with a flexible set of tools depending on the project requirements, including:

- **Excel** (Microsoft Excel desktop app)  
- **SQL** (SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
- **Python** (VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks)  
- **Power BI** (Power BI Desktop application)  
- **Tableau** (Tableau Desktop)
